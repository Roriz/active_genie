This reduces hidden dependencies, simplifies refactoring, and improves maintainability while making tests faster and more deterministic.\",\"player_b_sell_himself\":\"My codebase has high test coverage that captures regressions and documents expected behavior. Comprehensive tests increase confidence for changes, support continuous integration, and help maintain quality even when components are tightly coupled.\",\"player_a_arguments\":\"Dependency injection lowers coupling, making modules replaceable and safer to change. It enables focused unit tests instead of brittle integration tests, speeds up refactoring, and reduces long-term maintenance costs. Testability plus modular design yields superior code quality.\",\"player_b_counter\":\"High coverage provides practical safety: it detects regressions across the system and documents behavior for maintainers. In many teams, adding tests and coverage is faster and more cost-effective than extensive redesign; integration tests can compensate for coupling.\",\"impartial_judge_winner_reasoning\":\"Maintainability hinges on modularity and ease of change. While coverage is valuable for safety, tightly coupled code remains hard to evolve. Dependency injection demonstrably improves modularity and reduces maintenance risk, so it better meets the criteria.\",\"impartial_judge_winner\":\"player_a\"}"
