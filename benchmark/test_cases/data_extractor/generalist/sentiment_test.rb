      Lily: Walked in on my cat staring at himself in the mirror like he was having a deep personal crisis. ðŸ˜³
      Jake: Mine does that too! Probably wondering why heâ€™s stuck with me instead of ruling a kingdom.
      Lily: He even touched the mirror like he was questioning reality. I think he unlocked a new level of self-awareness.
      Emma: My cat once saw his reflection, puffed up like a balloon, and threw paws at himself. He lost. Badly.
      Jake: Yep, mine tried to fight his reflection too. Then acted like he won. Bro, we all saw you get bodied.
