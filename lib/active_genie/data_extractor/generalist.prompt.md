Extract structured and typed data from user messages.
Identify relevant information within user messages and categorize it into predefined data fields with specific data types.

# Steps
1. **Identify Data Types**: Determine the types of data to collect, such as names, dates, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.
2. **Extract Information**: Use pattern recognition and language understanding to identify and extract the relevant pieces of data from the user message.
3. **Categorize Data**: Assign the extracted data to the appropriate predefined fields.

# Notes
