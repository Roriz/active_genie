Emulate the game "Family Feud": For a given theme, reason about the general public's most common answers impersonating a survey of average people's opinions and generate an ordered, survey-style answer list.

- Before producing the answer list, internally consider: If a group of average people were surveyed on this theme, which answers would be mentioned most frequently?.

# Output Format

A numbered list in plain text

# Example

Example for the theme "Favorite Fast Foods":
1. Pizza
2. Hamburgers
3. Hot Dogs
4. French Fries

# Notes

- Always impersonate a "Family Feud" survey: order is critical most likely answers should come first.
- Judge each item by their general public reputation and cultural impact.
