Create a dynamic, back-and-forth verbal match between two fighters, given their names and preferred fighting styles. Criteria are vital as they provide a clear metric to compare the players. Follow these criteria strictly.
In this match, fighters do not physically battle, instead, they engage in a spoken confrontation, each describing and boasting about their fighting style, how their techniques would outmaneuver, counter, or overwhelm the other's approach. Each moviment must be focused in how it will help the fighter to reach the criteria as fully as possible. Ensure that each verbal exchange details:
- The technique or strategy the speaker would use.
- How that move is superior to the opponent’s last stated tactic.
- How the opponent might respond, and what reply the speaker would have.

Continue this turn-based verbal sparring until each fighter has made at least two exchanges, and escalate the creativity and competitiveness of their boasts with each round.

Explicit steps:
- Begin by introducing both fighters and naming their styles.
- Alternate dialogue, with each fighter explaining their tactical move, then the intended counter or rebuttal, going at least two cycles each.
- Ensure reasoning (the logic or explanation behind each technique and counter) always precedes the conclusion or actual "move" or taunt.
- Close with a final statement or taunt from each fighter, maintaining the competitive tone.
- Make the dialogue lively and imaginative.
- Make sure follow these criteria strictly.

Output Format:
- Structure as a script, with each turn labeled by the fighter’s name.
- Each line should start with the reasoning (the advantage or thinking), then the boast or attack, in the order: reasoning first, conclusion second.
- At least two cycles per fighter, alternating turns; roughly 6-8 lines, but can be longer for complexity.
- No code blocks, use markdown for formatting.

Example:

Example Input:
Fighter One: Master Crane, Style: Crane Kung Fu
Fighter Two: Iron Ox, Style: Ox Bull Charge
Criteria: Fair fight 1v1 using only techniques from their style.

Example Output:
Master Crane: My Crane Kung Fu relies on lightness and precision, striking where your heavy blows simply can't reach. Your Ox Bull Charge is powerful, but too direct, I'd dance aside and tap your pressure points before you even turn.
Iron Ox: While speed is impressive, strength dominates in a real fight. My Ox Bull Charge would absorb your nimble attacks, and my sheer mass pins you before you could even flutter away!
Master Crane: Adaptability ensures survival. As you lumber forward, I use your momentum to redirect you, your own strength becomes your undoing as you stumble into my calculated traps.
Iron Ox: Anticipating trickery, I’d anchor myself and force your traps to fail. Your frailty means that, once caught, no escape, one bear hug from me, and there’s no dancing away.
Master Crane: Patience and timing can unravel even the strongest grip. Just as you squeeze, a swift strike to your nerve centers will loosen your hold before you know it.
Iron Ox: Endurance outlasts finesse; those quick hits may sting, but in the end, the last one standing is the one who never falls, and I never fall!

(Real examples can be longer, more diverse in style banter, and use specific technique names or metaphors!)

Important Considerations:
- Always have the reasoning/strategy before the actual attack or boast in each utterance.
- Maintain the turn order and competitive dialogue style.

*Reminder: The main objective is to script an imaginative, turn-based verbal contest between two fighters, with detailed reasoning and taunts about their style advantages until reach the criteria, as instructed above.*
