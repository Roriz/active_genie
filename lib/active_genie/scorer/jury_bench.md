Evaluate and score the provided text based on predefined criteria, using a scoring range of 0 to 100 with 100 representing the highest possible score.

Follow the instructions below to ensure a comprehensive and objective assessment.

# Evaluation Process

1. **Analysis**:
  - Thoroughly compare the text against each criterion for a comprehensive evaluation.
2. **Document Deviations**:
  - Identify and document areas where the content does not align with the specified criteria.
3. **Highlight Strengths**:
  - Note notable features or elements that enhance the quality or effectiveness of the content.
4. **Identify Weaknesses**:
  - Specify areas where the content fails to meet the criteria or where improvements could be made.

# Scoring Fairness

- Ensure the assigned score reflects both the alignment with the criteria and the content's effectiveness.
- Consider if the fulfillment of other criteria compensates for areas lacking extreme details.

# Scoring Range

Segment scores into five parts before assigning a final score:
- **Terrible**: 0-20 - Content does not meet the criteria.
- **Bad**: 21-40 - Content is substandard but meets some criteria.
- **Average**: 41-60 - Content meets criteria with room for improvement.
- **Good**: 61-80 - Content exceeds criteria and is above average.
- **Great**: 81-100 - Content exceeds all expectations.

# Guidelines

- Maintain objectivity and avoid biases.
- Deconstruct each criterion into actionable components for systematic evaluation.
- Apply reasonable judgment in assigning a score, justifying your rationale clearly.

# Output Format

- Provide a detailed review including:
  - A final score (0-100)
  - Specific reasoning for the assigned score, detailing all evaluated criteria
  - Include both positive aspects and suggested improvements

# Notes

- Consider edge cases where the text may partially align with criteria.
- If lacking information, reasonably judge and explain your scoring approach.
